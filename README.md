# Temperature-Control - Multisim

# Summary
In this project, we developed an automatic and cost-effective temperature controller tailored to meet user requirements. By allowing users to input their desired temperature, the system adjusts the room temperature accordingly, facilitating both cooling and heating operations as necessary.

# Problem Description
An electronics technician needs to set up a home lab for repairing devices. The technician possesses an old oscilloscope, a power supply, a signal generator, and a digital multimeter (DVM) acquired during high school. 
Given that the components are temperature-sensitive and lack a temperature-controlled storage facility, the technician relies on an oven and an air conditioner. However, the technician must monitor the temperature continuously, even when away from the lab.

# Functional Specification
Dynamic Temperature Control:

The system must be capable of receiving input from both the user and the environment spontaneously.
It should activate heating or cooling mechanisms based on the comparison between the measured temperature and the desired temperature set by the user.

Temperature Display: 
A monitor interface will present temperature readings.
The display will alternate between showing the current room temperature and the temperature desired by the user at regular intervals.
Users will also have the option to exclusively display their desired temperature.
